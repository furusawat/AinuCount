# AinuCount

https://furusawat.github.io/AinuCount/

This is my personal project that helps to learn the counting system in Ainu language (Saru dialect).
My program is originally written in Python, and I convert it into JavaScript with [Brython](https://brython.info/).

Note: This project is heavily in WIP.
